    "## Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial implements [Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5775-learning-structured-output-representation-using-deep-conditional-generati) paper, which introduced **Conditional Variational Auto-encoders** in 2015, using Pyro PPL.\n",

    "Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied for many recognition problems in machine learning and computer vision. Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function very well when large number of training data is provided, the lack of probabilistic inference of the current supervised deep learning methods makes it difficult to model a complex structured output representations. In this work, Kihyuk Sohn, Honglak Lee and Xinchen Yan develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows a fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. They called the model Conditional Variational Auto-encoder (CVAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CVAE is a conditional directed graphical model whose input observations modulate the prior on Gaussian latent variables that generate the outputs. It is trained to maximize the conditional log-likelihood. The authors formulate the variational learning objective of the CVAE in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB). In experiments, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the CVAE in comparison to the deterministic neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic output predictions using stochastic inference. Here, we will implement their proof of concept: an artificial experimental setting for structured output prediction using MNIST database.\n",
